# CraftManager
This is CraftManager, a modpack manager designed to save your time.
If you're tired of losing time changing modpacks an managing them to the folders they belong, use this app
to easily choose wich modpack you're going to use and just start your game.




- I stopped working on this project, but the main back-end code still works, fell free to use it and make it better

# How to use?
- install Python3+ 
- Run the script
- copy the .minecraft/mods dir location and paste into into the app
- (its probably gonna close, i've not solved this bug, but the app will work if you open it again)
- tha app is ready and good to go, import your modpacks into the craftmanager and leave it to do the rest for you
## this app is meant for you to quickly ch0ose wich modpack (from the ones you already imported) you're goingo to play
it will move files into the correct locations automatically, I was planning to add an graphical interface using electron.js
but i'm not the biggest fan of html and css, so, i just stopped working on it for now, maybe in the future i will start 
working on it again.

notes: The cmAPI can also be used in other programs of your desire as a faster and easier way to handle files with python
I found out that tha native way to do so, is not that easy, so I built the cmAPI to make things easier.
